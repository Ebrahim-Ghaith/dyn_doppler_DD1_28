I tried to use the 'dyn_doppler_DD1_28' scenario, but I didn't find the users' channels after running the script of matlab code.

You can download the dataset from https://www.deepmimo.net/scenarios/v3/dynamic-doppler-dd1

It should be extracted under the folder 'Raytracing_scenarios'

The error was captured in the figure Error.png
